For the test file:
Each test should have size of 4 lines long. Labeled as:
1st line: Order of first polynomial
2nd line: Coefficients of first polynomial
3rd line: Order of second polynomial
4th line: Coefficients of second polynomial

Coefficient indices:
the first index of coefficients is the RHS
and each index after the first is added with increasing x powers starting from x^0
EXAMPLE coefficient line: 0 1 3 2 -> 2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0

For the Manual testing it is the same but you have to type it manually.
